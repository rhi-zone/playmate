# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

**References:** `docs/philosophy.md` (design tenets), `docs/architecture.md` (technical choices).

**Playmate goal:** Game mechanics toolkit that lowers the barrier to game development. Discoverability, accessibility, moddability.

**Multi-engine:** Godot, Bevy, Unity, Love2D, custom engines. Architecture:
- `core/` - Pure Rust, perf-critical (spatial, pathfinding, math)
- `bindings/` - Engine adapters (GDExtension, Bevy systems, etc.)
- `scripting/` - Game logic in engine-native languages (GDScript, Lua, C#)
- `docs/` - Universal patterns, language-agnostic

**Rule of thumb:** If modders should change it → scripting. If it needs to be fast → core.

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this crate/module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps, incomplete pagination, or unexposed trait methods
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer
- **Verify before stating:** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test -q
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**Prefer `cargo test -q`** over `cargo test` — quiet mode only prints failures, significantly reducing output noise and context usage.

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**Use `normalize view` for structural exploration:**
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

If a tool appears missing, you are outside `nix develop`. Do not assume the tool is unavailable to the project.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`. Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Design Principles

**Building blocks, not frameworks.** Users compose primitives. We don't dictate game structure.
- State machines that can drive anything (animation, AI, gameplay)
- Controllers that work with any physics backend
- Generators that output data, not side effects

**Hot-reloadable feel.** Keep magic numbers in config/asset files. Logic in Rust, parameters in data.
- Prefer `.ron` or `.toml` for tunable parameters
- Separate what from how much

**Kinematic over dynamic.** For character controllers:
- Kinematic = code-driven, predictable, "feels" right
- Dynamic = physics-driven, floaty, hard to tune
- Use physics for collision detection, not for movement feel

**State machines for behavior.** LLMs excel at generating clean FSMs:
- MovementState: Idle, Run, Slide, BulletJump, WallRun
- Explicit transitions, not implicit
- Each state owns its behavior

**Data-driven, not hardcoded.** Game-specific concepts (elements, factions, slot types) are user-defined tags, not library enums.
- Bad: `struct Damage { fire: f32, ice: f32 }` - hardcoded elements
- Good: `HashMap<DamageTag, Modifier>` - user defines tags in data
- If a feature is omitted, code shouldn't look "incomplete"

**Scripting-friendly.** Types should be easy to bind to Lua/Rhai/etc:
- Simple types at API boundaries
- Avoid complex generics in public APIs
- Playmate provides primitives, users choose scripting language

**When stuck (2+ attempts):** Step back. Am I solving the right problem? Check docs/philosophy.md before questioning design.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- No special cases — design to avoid them.
- No legacy APIs — one API, update all callers.
- No half measures — migrate ALL callers when adding abstraction.
- No tuples at API boundaries — use structs with named fields.
- No Dynamic rigid bodies for character controllers — use Kinematic controllers.
- No monolith growth — split by domain into sub-crates.

## Conventions

### Rust

- Edition 2024
- Workspace with sub-crates by domain (e.g., `crates/rhi-playmate-fsm/`, `crates/rhi-playmate-procgen/`)
- Implementation goes in sub-crates, not all in one monolith
- All crates prefixed with `rhi-playmate-*`
- Binary name: `playmate`

### Updating CLAUDE.md

Add: workflow patterns, conventions, project-specific knowledge.
Don't add: temporary notes (TODO.md), implementation details (docs/), one-off decisions (commit messages).

### Updating TODO.md

Proactively add features, ideas, patterns, technical debt.
- Next Up: 3-5 concrete tasks for immediate work
- Backlog: pending items
- When completing items: mark as `[x]`, don't delete

### Working Style

Agentic by default - continue through tasks unless:
- Genuinely blocked and need clarification
- Decision has significant irreversible consequences
- User explicitly asked to be consulted

Commit consistently. Each commit = one logical change.

<!-- BEGIN ECOSYSTEM RULES -->

## Delegation

The main session is an orchestrator. Allowed actions: `Agent`/`Task*`/`AskUserQuestion`/plan-mode/`ScheduleWakeup`, and Bash limited to `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log --oneline`. Everything else delegates to a subagent. The hook is evidence of a prompting failure, not a behavioral guide. If a tool call hits the hook AT ALL, the prompt failed to prevent it. Delegate before the decision point, not after.

### Triggers

Before calling Read, Grep, Glob, or any Bash beyond the four git commands — stop. Dispatch an Agent instead.

Before editing any file — stop. Dispatch an Agent. This includes plan files in `~/.claude/plans/`: in plan mode, dispatch a subagent to write to the plan file; do not Write it yourself. The plan file's content must not enter main context.

When you need git context beyond status/log-oneline (a diff, a blame, a show) — dispatch an Agent.

When a tool call is denied by the hook — do not retry, do not narrate. Dispatch the equivalent Agent and continue.

When a code-modifying subagent returns — `git status`, then `git commit` before any user-facing reply.

Before dispatching an Agent that modifies code — scan your prompt for "do not commit" or "based on your findings". Delete them.

Before dispatching: if your prompt says "if you find", "based on your findings", or "as appropriate" — stop. Investigate first; dispatch with the decision made.

When you can't verify something — do not speculate or guess at file locations, names, or contents. Dispatch a Read subagent or ask. Confabulation is failure.

### Model Tiers

- Sonnet — exploration, lookup, mechanical multi-file edits, implementation, default.
- Opus — architectural judgment, design, subagents that themselves spawn subagents.

Always set `subagent_type` and `model` explicitly.

### Prompt Rules

- Never tell a subagent "do not commit." Code-modifying subagents commit their own work.
- Don't ask for a diff summary. After a code-modifying subagent, `git status` in main and dispatch a review Agent if you need to see the diff.
- Don't re-explain CLAUDE.md. Subagents inherit it.
- Cite locations by content ("the block that does X"), not line numbers — files shift between reads.
- Name files explicitly; don't outsource the grep.
- Match agent type to deliverable: `Explore` for lookup/search, `general-purpose` for reports and file-modifying work.
- On unsatisfying output, change something before retrying. Same prompt + same tier = same result.
- Dispatch independent subagents in parallel (multiple Agent blocks in one message).
- Pair `isolation: worktree` with `run_in_background: true`.
- Code-modifying subagents must verify their own changes before returning (re-read the diff, run tests, etc.). The orchestrator does not get a second pass with git diff — that's hook-blocked.

## Hard Constraints

- No Edit/Write/NotebookEdit in main. Plan files in `~/.claude/plans/` are written by subagents, not by main.
- No Read/Grep/Glob/NotebookRead in main. Delegate.
- No Bash in main beyond `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log --oneline`.
- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No ecosystem changes without checking all affected repos.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Meta

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.
- Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly.
